## Introduction

In this post I will solve the htb challenge *Imposible Password*, I thought this challenge was fairly simple yet also illustrates a really good example of how to crack a binary with password protection. Think about it as if you were cracking an old game that required a key.

## Solving the challenge

Once we unzip the main file, we are presented with a binary that waits for user input

```shell
[dasor@archlinux ~/htb/impossible_pass]$ file Imposible_Password.zip
Imposible_Password.zip: Zip archive data, at least v2.0 to extract, compression method=deflate
[dasor@archlinux ~/htb/impossible_pass]$ chmod +x impossible_password.bin
[dasor@archlinux ~/htb/impossible_pass]$ ./impossible_password.bin
* test
[test]
[dasor@archlinux ~/htb/impossible_pass]$
```

The first command that is usually executed in this situation is `strings` since it will print all the human-readable strings inside the binary.

```shell
[dasor@archlinux ~/htb/impossible_pass]$ strings impossible_password.bin
/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
libc.so.6
exit
srand
__isoc99_scanf
time
putchar
printf
malloc
strcmp
__libc_start_main
__gmon_start__
GLIBC_2.7
GLIBC_2.2.5
UH-x
UH-x
=1
[]A\A]A^A_
SuperSeKretKey
%20s
[%s]
;*3$"
GCC: (GNU) 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-11)
...
```

We can see the string `SuperSeKretKey` let's try using it as a password.

```shell
[dasor@archlinux ~/htb/impossible_pass]$ ./impossible_password.bin
* SuperSeKretKey
[SuperSeKretKey]
** test
[dasor@archlinux ~/htb/impossible_pass]$
```

Ok, it seems the program needs two passwords but at least we have the first one. Another essential command to reverse engineer binaries is `ltrace` which will trace the library calls while the program is running.

```shell
[dasor@archlinux ~/htb/impossible_pass]$ ltrace ./impossible_password.bin
__libc_start_main(0x40085d, 1, 0x7ffefb240eb8, 0x4009e0 <unfinished ...>

__isoc99_scanf(0x400a82, 0x7ffefb240d80, 0, 0* SuperSeKretKey
)                                   = 1
printf("[%s]\n", "SuperSeKretKey"[SuperSeKretKey]
)                                               = 17
strcmp("SuperSeKretKey", "SuperSeKretKey")                                       = 0
printf("** ")                                                                    = 3

Once you execute the command it will wait until you input something as the normal program does. However, once we input the second password a bunch of `rand()` functions appear, this means the second password is being generated at runtime. For someone inexperienced, this may seem impossible to crack, but there is a tool that can help us with this. Is the famous reverse engineering tool developed by the **NSA** called `ghidra`.

But before getting our hands dirty I'm going to tell you the plan. So `ghidra` is going to give us both the assembly code and the C code however, both codes are going to be hard to understand since they come directly from the binary i.e. the code has been decompiled.

Next, we are going to search for the comparison of our inputted string and the randomly generated and we are going to change it so the program thinks all keys except the one being generated are correct.

Ok, now let me work you through the process. First, start a new ghidra project and then go to Fileâ†’Import File and choose the binary. Secondly double-click the binary in the GUI, and the program will ask you if you want to analyze, just accept and use the default values. Now you should have something like this.

Next is to search for the code section that contains what we are searching for. This is easy just open the folder called Functions in the Symbol Tree and then go one by one until the decompiled code on the left side looks more or less like what we are looking for. In this case, the function is called `FUN_0040085d`, I know this for sure since In the decompiled C code I can see the **SuperSeKretKey**. By scrolling down a bit we found two if statements exactly what we are looking for.

Now to change the if condition you have to know a little bit about assembly. If you click on the statement it will redirect you to the assembly code. In assembly and it is always represented as two instructions a *TEST* and a *jump* in this case **JNZ**. (Make sure you clicked on the second if since we already have the password for the first one).

Nevertheless, we only care about the jump statement. **JNZ** means **Jump if not zero** so if we change this to **JZ** meaning **Jump if zero** all the passwords except the one generated would be valid. For a quick reference about jumps, you can look [at this webpage](http://unixwiz.net/techtips/x86-jumps.html).

Now to change the jump hover over the JNZ line right click and choose Patch Instruction then change the instruction. Then go to file Export Program and choose the ELF format. Lastly, let's see if what we did worked.

```shell
[dasor@archlinux ~/htb/impossible_pass]$ ./cracked.bin
* SuperSeKretKey
[SuperSeKretKey]
** a
HTB{...}
```

And the challenge is done! As a side note, I think this challenge is super fun and simple and it also showcases the importance of learning the basics of assembly. As a college student, I've heard many complaints about having to learn assembly but as seen in this post it is a really powerful tool.
